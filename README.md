# EUREKA2020_Roomba
Repository for Python code used on Roombas for EUREKA 2.0 - Summer 2020.

Welcome to EUREKA 2.0 (Experiences in Undergraduate Research, Exploration amd Knowledge Advancement) at Clemson University. We will be using GitHub to organize and manage our Python code and other files for the project. GitHub allows us to incorporate necessary changes and updates from multiple users at the same time. Please become familiar with the layout and workflow of GitHub. Let me (mathman93) know if you have any questions.
